Overview: This project was a full stack web service developed by a group of five members. We used Laravel(PHP), VueJS(JS, Tailwind CSS, HTML), and Docker to develop this project. The goal was to create a web service for both Cal Poly Pomona(CPP) students and property owners to use. The site was aimed to help CPP students find roommates and properties near campus that are available for rent. It would also serve as an easy way for property owners in the area to list property as available for rent. For this project, I mainly worked on the front end, but I also did help a bit with the back end, such as linking pages together and passing data to the front end.
